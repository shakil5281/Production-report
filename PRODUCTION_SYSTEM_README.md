# Production Management System

A comprehensive production management system for tracking hourly production per factory line, managing expenses, cashbook, and generating profit & loss reports.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Core Entities

#### 1. Factory & Lines
- **Factory**: Production facilities with multiple production lines
- **Line**: Individual production lines within factories (6 lines as specified)
- Each line can be assigned multiple styles and track production across stages

#### 2. Style & Assignments
- **Style**: Garment styles with buyer info, PO numbers, quantities, and pricing
- **StyleAssignment**: Links styles to production lines with start/end dates and hourly targets
- Status tracking: PENDING ‚Üí RUNNING ‚Üí WAITING ‚Üí COMPLETE ‚Üí CANCELLED

#### 3. Production Tracking
- **ProductionEntry**: Hourly granular tracking (0-23 hours) per line/style/stage
- **Stages**: CUTTING ‚Üí SEWING ‚Üí FINISHING
- **Metrics**: Input quantity, output quantity, defects, rework, WIP calculation
- **WIP Formula**: Cumulative input - output per stage

#### 4. Financial Management
- **Expense**: Daily expenses by category (salary, utilities, materials, etc.)
- **Cashbook**: Debit/credit entries with running balance calculation
- **Profit & Loss**: Earned production - expenses = profit

#### 5. Shipment Tracking
- **Shipment**: Style-based shipment records with destination and tracking info
- Revenue recognition on finishing output or shipment (configurable policy)

## üìä Key Features

### Production Dashboard
- **Real-time Status**: Running/Pending/Complete/Waiting by style & line
- **Hourly Tracking**: Granular production data for each stage
- **WIP Monitoring**: Work-in-progress calculation across stages
- **Efficiency Metrics**: Input/output ratios, defect rates, rework tracking

### Financial Tracking
- **Daily Expenses**: Salary, cash expenses, utilities, maintenance, materials
- **Cashbook**: Debit/credit tracking with running balance
- **Profit & Loss**: Daily/weekly/monthly calculations
- **Revenue Recognition**: Based on finished production output

### Reporting & Analytics
- **Production Reports**: By line, style, date range, stage
- **Shipment Reports**: By style, PO, destination, date
- **Financial Reports**: Expense breakdown, P&L analysis, cash flow
- **Performance Metrics**: Line efficiency, style progress, defect analysis

## üîê Role-Based Access Control

### User Roles
- **USER**: View production data, basic reports
- **MANAGER**: Create/update production entries, manage expenses, view all reports
- **ADMIN**: Full system access, user management, system settings
- **SUPER_ADMIN**: Complete system control, audit logs

### Permission Matrix
- Production entries: MANAGER+ (create/update), ADMIN+ (delete)
- Expenses: MANAGER+ (create), ADMIN+ (full access)
- Cashbook: MANAGER+ (create), ADMIN+ (full access)
- Shipments: MANAGER+ (create), ADMIN+ (full access)
- System settings: ADMIN+ only

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

### Core Tables
```sql
-- Production tracking
production_entries (id, date, hour_index, line_id, style_id, stage, input_qty, output_qty, defect_qty, rework_qty)

-- Financial management
expenses (id, date, line_id, category_id, amount, payment_method)
cashbook_entries (id, date, type, amount, category, running_balance)

-- Master data
factories (id, name, is_active)
lines (id, factory_id, name, code, is_active)
styles (id, style_number, buyer, po_number, order_qty, unit_price, status)
expense_categories (id, name, is_salary_flag)
```

### Key Relationships
- Line belongs to Factory
- Style assigned to Line via StyleAssignment
- ProductionEntry linked to Line + Style + Stage
- Expense linked to Line + Category
- CashbookEntry linked to Line (optional)

## üìà Business Logic

### Production Calculations
- **WIP = Input - Output** (per stage)
- **Efficiency = (Output / Input) √ó 100**
- **Defect Rate = (Defects / Output) √ó 100**
- **Rework Rate = (Rework / Output) √ó 100**

### Financial Calculations
- **Revenue = Finished Output √ó Unit Price**
- **Profit = Revenue - Expenses**
- **Profit Margin = (Profit / Revenue) √ó 100**
- **Running Balance = Cumulative Credits - Debits**

### Status Logic
- **PENDING**: Style assigned but no production started
- **RUNNING**: Production in progress (any stage has output)
- **WAITING**: Past start date but no production
- **COMPLETE**: Finished output ‚â• order quantity
- **CANCELLED**: Manually cancelled orders

## üîÑ Data Flow

### Daily Production Cycle
1. **Morning Setup**: Review line assignments and targets
2. **Hourly Tracking**: Record input/output for each stage
3. **Real-time Updates**: Monitor WIP and efficiency
4. **End-of-Day**: Review production vs. targets, record expenses

### Financial Cycle
1. **Expense Recording**: Daily salary, materials, utilities
2. **Cashbook Updates**: Track all money in/out
3. **Production Revenue**: Calculate earned revenue from finished goods
4. **P&L Calculation**: Daily/weekly/monthly profit analysis
