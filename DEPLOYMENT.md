# Production Report - Deployment Guide

## Vercel Deployment

This project has been configured to work properly with Vercel deployment. The main issues that were fixed:

### 1. Prisma Build Issue
- **Problem**: Prisma Client wasn't being generated during Vercel build
- **Solution**: Added `prisma generate` to build script and `postinstall` script

### 2. API Route Build Errors
- **Problem**: API routes were trying to connect to Prisma during build time
- **Solution**: Made Prisma imports conditional using dynamic imports

### 3. Build Configuration
- **vercel.json**: Proper build configuration for Next.js + Prisma
- **package.json**: Updated build scripts for Vercel compatibility

## Environment Variables

Make sure to set these environment variables in your Vercel project:

```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL="your-postgresql-connection-string"

# NextAuth (if using authentication)
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-secret-key"
NEXTAUTH_URL="https://your-domain.vercel.app"

# Environment
NODE_ENV="production"
```

## Build Process

The build process now includes:
1. `prisma generate` - Generates Prisma Client
2. `next build` - Builds Next.js application
3. Proper error handling for API routes

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter build issues:

1. **Check Environment Variables**: Ensure all required env vars are set in Vercel
2. **Database Connection**: Verify your DATABASE_URL is accessible from Vercel
3. **Prisma Version**: Ensure you're using a compatible Prisma version
4. **Build Logs**: Check Vercel build logs for specific error messages
