  - `md:` (768px+) - Tablets and small laptops
  - `lg:` (1024px+) - Laptops and desktops

### Grid and Flexbox Layouts
- **Grid patterns**:
  - `grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4` for summary cards
  - `sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-5` for filter forms
  - `sm:grid-cols-2` for form layouts

- **Flex patterns**:
  - `flex-col sm:flex-row` for responsive header layouts
  - `justify-center sm:justify-end` for responsive alignment

### Typography and Spacing
- **Responsive text sizing**:
  - `text-2xl sm:text-3xl` for main headings
  - `text-xs sm:text-sm` for smaller text and table headers
  - `text-lg sm:text-2xl` for card values

- **Responsive spacing**:
  - `gap-3 sm:gap-4` for responsive grid gaps
  - `py-3 px-3 sm:py-4 sm:px-4` for responsive padding

### Interactive Elements
- **Button responsiveness**:
  - `w-full sm:w-auto` for buttons that are full-width on mobile
  - Enhanced touch targets for mobile navigation
  - Proper spacing and sizing for touch interaction

## Testing and Validation

### Build Status
✅ Project builds successfully with all responsive updates
✅ No TypeScript errors or compilation issues
✅ All components maintain proper functionality

### Components Updated
- [x] Dashboard page and components
